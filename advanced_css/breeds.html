    <h1>Breading Information</h1>
    <h2>Type of Breeds</h2>
    <p>Pitbulls aren’t just one breed—they’re a group of muscular, loyal dogs that include four main types: the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and American Bully. Each has a slightly different build and temperament, but they all share a reputation for being affectionate and eager to please when properly trained. The American Pit Bull Terrier is known for its athleticism and drive, while the American Bully tends to be stockier and more laid-back. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are compact and adventurous, often described as great family companions. Despite their misunderstood image, these breeds are deeply loving and thrive in homes that offer structure, socialization, and lots of attention.

<h3>Breeding Controversy</h3>
<p>Breeding pit bulls is a topic filled with controversy due to concerns about health, temperament, and the ethics of breeding practices. Some argue that responsible breeding can help improve the breed's overall health and temperament, while others believe that the focus should be on rescuing and adopting existing dogs rather than breeding new ones. Additionally, there are concerns about overbreeding and the potential for irresponsible breeders to prioritize profit over the well-being of the dogs. It's important for potential breeders to prioritize health testing, proper socialization, and ethical practices to ensure that pit bulls are bred to be healthy, well-adjusted companions.</p>
